Of course! Markdown is an excellent format for this. You can copy the text below and save it as a `.md` file.

Many tools like VS Code (with the "Markdown All in One" extension), Marp, or Deckset can turn this Markdown directly into a slideshow. The `---` syntax is a common convention for separating slides.

---

### **How to use this file:**
*   Each section separated by `---` represents a new slide.
*   The text in blockquotes (`>`) are your speaker notes for each slide.
*   **Remember to edit the placeholder values on Slide 4!**

# **DORA Metrics: Measuring What Matters**

### A Quick Look at Our Team's DevOps Performance

**Presenter:** [Your Name]
**Date:** [Date of Presentation]

> **(Speaker Notes - 15 seconds):** "Hi everyone. In the next five minutes, I want to give a quick introduction to DORA metrics and show how we can use them to see how we’re doing and where we can improve."

## **What is DORA & Why Should We Care?**

### From Guesswork to Insight

*   **What is DORA?**
    *   **D**evOps **R**esearch and **A**ssessment – a multi-year research program from Google.
    *   It identified the key metrics that predict high-performing teams.

*   **Why Should We Care?**
    *   It’s the industry standard for measuring software delivery performance.
    *   It helps us answer: Are we getting faster? Is our service reliable?
    *   It’s about improving our **system**, not judging individuals.

> **(Speaker Notes - 60 seconds):** "So, what is DORA? It’s a famous research project, now part of Google, that figured out exactly which metrics separate elite-performing teams from the rest. The goal is to move from *feeling* like we're doing better to *knowing* we are, based on objective data. It helps us focus on improving our overall process, not on individual performance."

## **The Four Key Metrics**

### Balancing Speed and Stability

### **THROUGHPUT (Speed)**

*   **Deployment Frequency (DF):**
    *   How often we release to production.
    *   *(More often is better)*

*   **Lead Time for Changes (LTFC):**
    *   How long it takes from a code commit to get into production.
    *   *(Shorter is better)*

### **STABILITY**

*   **Change Failure Rate (CFR):**
    *   What percentage of our deployments cause a failure in production.
    *   *(Lower is better)*

*   **Time to Restore Service (TTRS):**
    *   When a failure occurs, how long it takes us to recover.
    *   *(Shorter is better)*

> **(Speaker Notes - 90 seconds):** "DORA gives us four key metrics, perfectly balanced between speed and stability. For speed, we have **Deployment Frequency**—are we shipping daily, weekly, or monthly? And **Lead Time for Changes**—how long does an idea take to get to our users? For stability, we have **Change Failure Rate**—how often do our changes break things? And **Time to Restore Service**—when things do break, how fast can we fix them? You can't succeed by just focusing on one side; you need both."

## **Our Team's Performance Snapshot**

### Our Performance for [Specify Period, e.g., Q3 2023]

| Metric | Our Team's Result | Performance Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deployment Frequency** | `[e.g., 5 per week]` | `High` |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | `[e.g., 3 days]` | `Medium` |
| **Change Failure Rate** | `[e.g., 20%]` | `Medium` |
| **Time to Restore Service** | `[e.g., 8 hours]` | `Low` |

**Key Message:** This isn't a grade—it's our baseline for improvement.

> **(Speaker Notes - 75 seconds):** "So, where do we stand? Here’s a snapshot of our performance over the last [period]. As you can see, our **Deployment Frequency** is strong—we're in the 'High' performing bracket. That's awesome. Our **Lead Time** and **Change Failure Rate** are in the 'Medium' range, showing we have a clear opportunity to improve. Our biggest opportunity for growth is our **Time to Restore Service**, which is currently in the 'Low' bracket. This is our starting point for focused improvement."

## **What's Next?**

### Key Takeaway & Next Steps

*   **Key Takeaway:**
    *   DORA gives us a shared, objective language to talk about our delivery performance.

*   **Opportunity:**
    *   Based on the data, our biggest opportunity seems to be improving our **Time to Restore Service**.

*   **Call to Action:**
    *   Let's dedicate time in our next retrospective to brainstorm one small experiment we can try to improve this.

### **Questions?**

> **(Speaker Notes - 60 seconds):** "The key takeaway here is that DORA gives us a common language to discuss our performance. Based on this data, it looks like our biggest opportunity is to get faster at recovering from incidents. My suggestion is that in our next retro, we specifically discuss this. What are your thoughts? Any questions?"
