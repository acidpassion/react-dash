Of course! Here is a concise 5-minute presentation plan to introduce DORA metrics and share your team's performance. This plan is structured slide-by-slide with talking points and time estimates.

**Goal:** Quickly explain what DORA is, why it matters, and present a snapshot of our team's current performance to spark a conversation about improvement.

**Audience:** Your team (devs, QA, ops, product managers).

**Tone:** Informative, collaborative, and forward-looking. This is about *system improvement*, not individual judgment.

### **The 5-Minute DORA Presentation Plan**

#### **Slide 1: Title Slide (15 seconds)**

*   **Title:** DORA Metrics: Measuring What Matters
*   **Subtitle:** A Quick Look at Our Team's DevOps Performance
*   **Presenter:** Your Name
*   **Date:** Today's Date

**(What to say):** "Hi everyone. In the next five minutes, I want to give a quick introduction to DORA metrics and show how we can use them to see how we’re doing and where we can improve."

#### **Slide 2: What is DORA & Why Should We Care? (60 seconds)**

*   **Headline:** From Guesswork to Insight
*   **Content:**
    *   **What is it?** DORA stands for **DevOps Research and Assessment**. It’s a multi-year research program (originally by Google) that identified the key metrics that predict high-performing teams.
    *   **Why care?** It's the industry standard for measuring software delivery performance. It helps us answer:
        *   Are we delivering value faster?
        *   Is our service reliable?
        *   Are our process improvements actually working?
    *   **Key Idea:** It’s not about blaming people; it's about improving our **system**.

**(What to say):** "So, what is DORA? It’s a famous research project, now part of Google, that figured out exactly which metrics separate elite-performing teams from the rest. The goal is to move from *feeling* like we're doing better to *knowing* we are, based on objective data. It helps us focus on improving our overall process, not on individual performance."

#### **Slide 3: The Four Key Metrics (90 seconds)**

*   **Headline:** The 4 Metrics: Balancing Speed and Stability
*   **Visual:** Two columns: **Throughput (Speed)** and **Stability**.

*   **Column 1: THROUGHPUT (How fast can we deliver?)**
    *   **Deployment Frequency (DF):** How often do we release to production? (More often is better)
    *   **Lead Time for Changes (LTFC):** How long does it take from a code commit to get into production? (Shorter is better)

*   **Column 2: STABILITY (How reliable is our service?)**
    *   **Change Failure Rate (CFR):** What percentage of our deployments cause a failure? (Lower is better)
    *   **Time to Restore Service (TTRS):** When a failure occurs, how long does it take us to recover? (Shorter is better)

**(What to say):** "DORA gives us four key metrics, perfectly balanced between speed and stability. For speed, we have **Deployment Frequency**—are we shipping daily, weekly, or monthly? And **Lead Time for Changes**—how long does an idea take to get to our users? For stability, we have **Change Failure Rate**—how often do our changes break things? And **Time to Restore Service**—when things do break, how fast can we fix them? You can't succeed by just focusing on one side; you need both."

#### **Slide 4: Our Team's Performance Snapshot (75 seconds)**

*   **Headline:** Our Numbers for [Specify Period, e.g., "Q3 2023" or "Last Month"]
*   **Visual:** A simple table or four clear boxes with your team's metrics. Add the DORA performance benchmarks (Elite, High, Medium, Low) for context.

| Metric | Our Team's Result | Performance Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deployment Frequency** | `[e.g., 5 per week]` | `High` |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | `[e.g., 3 days]` | `Medium` |
| **Change Failure Rate** | `[e.g., 20%]` | `Medium` |
| **Time to Restore Service** | `[e.g., 8 hours]` | `Low` |

**(What to say):** "So, where do we stand? Here’s a snapshot of our performance over the last [period]. As you can see, our **Deployment Frequency** is strong—we're in the 'High' performing bracket. That's awesome. Our **Lead Time** and **Change Failure Rate** are in the 'Medium' range, showing we have a clear opportunity to improve how quickly and reliably we get code out. Our biggest opportunity for growth is our **Time to Restore Service**, which is currently in the 'Low' bracket. This isn't a grade—it's a baseline. It gives us a starting point for focused improvement."

#### **Slide 5: What's Next? (60 seconds)**

*   **Headline:** Key Takeaway & Next Steps
*   **Content:**
    *   **Key Takeaway:** DORA gives us a shared language to talk about our delivery performance.
    *   **Discussion Point:** Based on the data, our biggest opportunity seems to be reducing our **Time to Restore Service**.
    *   **Call to Action:** Let's dedicate some time in our next retrospective to brainstorm one or two small experiments we could try to improve this metric.
    *   **Open the Floor:** "Any questions?"

**(What to say):** "The key takeaway here is that DORA gives us a common language to discuss our performance. Based on this data, it looks like our biggest opportunity is to get faster at recovering from incidents. My suggestion is that in our next retro, we specifically discuss this. What are your thoughts? Any questions?"

### **Pre-Presentation Pro-Tips:**

1.  **Get the Data:** Before you create the slides, make sure you have the data for Slide 4. You can get this from your CI/CD tools (like Jenkins, GitLab CI), version control (Git), and incident management systems (PagerDuty, Opsgenie). A good estimate is better than nothing for a first presentation.
2.  **Practice:** Time yourself! 5 minutes goes by very fast. Cut out any words or concepts that aren't essential.
3.  **Anticipate Questions:** Be ready for "Where does this data come from?" and "Is this for performance reviews?" (The answer to the latter should always be **NO**).
